# Binary Latent Diffusion

This repo contains the Pytorch implementation of [Binary Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04820). 

We currently provide:

- a text-to-image generation demo under `text-to-image-demo`. 

- training instructions and models for binary autoencoders under `binary-ae`

- training instructions and models for Bernoulli diffusion under `bernoulli-diffusion`

We will upload more scripts and models later. 

This implementation is based on the following projects:

https://github.com/samb-t/unleashing-transformers

https://github.com/ehoogeboom/multinomial_diffusion

This implementation still requires further cleaning and commenting, If you have any questions, please reach out to the author at wang5026@purdue.edu
