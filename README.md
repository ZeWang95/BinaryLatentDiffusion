# Binary Latent Diffusion

This repo contains the Pytorch implementation of [Binary Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04820). 

We currently provide a text-to-image generation demo under `text-to-image-demo`. We will upload more scripts and models later. 

This implementation is based on the following projects:

https://github.com/samb-t/unleashing-transformers
